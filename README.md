# Scan-One-Barcode-From-Many

A simple web app demo of scanning one barcode from many barcodes. It uses [Dynamsoft Camera Enhancer](https://www.dynamsoft.com/camera-enhancer/docs/introduction/) to get camera video frames and uses [Dynamsoft Barcode Reader](https://www.dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/overview/) to read barcodes from the frames.
